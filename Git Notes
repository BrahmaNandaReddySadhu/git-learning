1) why Git and Git Hub?

case1:

Imagine I have One application it working fine now 
let Assume that I have added new Functionality to my existing application , after adding new Functionality my application is breaking or not working.
Now I want to go back to my previous version of the code where my application is working fine earlier before adding the new feature or functionality,

so Git and Git hub came into picture 
It Saving or Maintains History of the project like what are the changes you have made on specific dates ,in which are the files you have made changes all those inforation it tracks 

Case 2:

You are Contributing to the open source Project where thousand of the people are Contributing , how these people share their code and make their code accessibe to all other open source contributing 
members ? throug  Git and git hub we can do all these things 

So  git and github allow to Maintain the History of the Project 
ie what are the changes made by which person , in which folder at what times all those information is stored 


Git :
Git is version control system which Maintain the History of the projects ie 
if anyone made some changes - what are the changes he had made to which file in the project and at what time he had made all these informatons will be stored

Git hub : 
Git hub is platform or online Website which allow us to host the Git repositories
repository is nothing but a folder where all the changes are saved


Bit Bucket , GitLabs are the there alternatives to git hub
